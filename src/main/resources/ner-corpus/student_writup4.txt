PATIENT PROFILE:
This is a 62 yo white female. 
CHIEF COMPLAINT:
Headache, nausea, vomiting, and diarhea 
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
This 62 yo female with a PMH notable for TTP in 1996 who presents with intermittent 
dizziness, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea of about
 1 week duration.  Over this period of 
time, she has been unable to take in any si
gnificant PO intake without vomiting.  Her 
dizziness and lightheadedness are most notable 
when she stands up, and she has difficulty 
maintaining her balance due to this.  She also 
notes that has been very tired for this past 
week, spending approximately 20 hours per da
y in bed sleeping.  She denies pain, 
headache, fevers, chills, SOB, chest pain, 
hematemesis, bloody stool, tarry stool, dysuria, 
hematuria, and increased bleed
ing or bruising.  The patient 
is unable to provide further 
details or further describe her symptoms, 
and has no idea what might be causing them.  
She does deny any recent sick contacts, eati
ng any new or abnormal foods, eating any 
potentially raw meats, and dri
nking large amounts of tonic wa
ter, or anything else that 
contains quinine. 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1981 – Cessarian section.  This wa
s her fourth and final child. 
August 1996 – 9 day hospital admission fo
r TTP.  Presented with nausea, 
vomiting, mental status change
s, headache, and exertional dyspnea.  After ruling out 
MI, meningitis, hepatic obstruction, rena
l insufficiency, and collagen vascular 
disease, the diagnosis of TTP was eventu
ally made.  Hospital course included 8 
sessions of plasmaphoresis, 4 sessions of he
modialysis, high dose IV steroids, and an 
open kidney biopsy which was complicated by a right pneumothorax.   
September 1996 – Presented to Duke ED with an infected Perma-Cath and hypokalemia. 
July 2000 – Presented to Duke 
ED with acute bronchitis a
nd bilateral ot
itis media. 
January 2001 – Presented to Duke ED after a fa
ll with fractures of the third and fourth 
metacarpals.  The hand was splinted and later casted 
December 2002 – Presented to DRH with dizzin
ess and left sided weakness.  CT showed 
two lacunar infarcts at the left basal 
ganglia, and well as ev
idence of some old 
infarcts.  The patient was discharg
ed after a four day hospital stay. 
August 2003 – Cataract surgery, left eye 
October 2003 – Cataract surgery, right eye 
January 2004 – Dilation and curetta
ge for postmenopausal bleeding 
In addition to these events, the pati
ent has current diagnoses of HTN and 
hypercholesterolemia.  She is unsure if she 
has CHF.  Her baselin
e creatinine, at the 
time of her elective D&C in January 2004, was 1.7. 
CURRENT MEDICATIONS:
Lasix, 20 mg PO daily 
Potassium Chloride, 8 meq PO daily 
Atenolol, 50 mg PO daily 
Lipitor, 10 mg PO daily 
ASA, 81 mg PO daily 
Norvasc, 5 mg PO daily 
A green “nerve pill” the patie
nt takes to reduce itching 
ALLERGIES/SENSITIVITIES:
NKDA
SOCIAL HISTORY:
The patient lives with her husband in an ap
artment in Durham.  The two of them are 
unable to care for themselves, so the patient’s
 sister and daughter 
alternate spending days 
caring for them.  She had four
 grown children.  She denies 
tobacco, alcohol, and drugs, 
lives with family.  She is not sure if she has ever been employed. 
HEALTH MAINENANCE:
The patient sees Dr. R as her PCP.  She ha
s had at least one mammogram, but it sounds 
like it has most likely been quite a while a
go.  Her most recent pap smear is documented 
as being 3/12/03, and it was 
normal.  She has never had a colonoscopy.  She is unsure 
what immunizations she has had.  She does see 
Dr. Rat least once a year and says she has 
little difficulty obtaining or
 taking her medications. 
FAMILY HISTORY:
Both of her parents are dead, but she does not
 remember how old they were when they 
died.  Her father had COPD and coronary artery
 disease.  Mother had diabetes and stoke.  
One of her siblings has congenital deftness. 
 Another sibling has 
adult onset diabetes. 
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:

DIAGNOSTIC TESTS:
EKG – nsr, 54 bpm 
ASSESSMENT/PLAN:
1) Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome)
Diagnostic Pentad: 
Microangiopathic hemolytic anemia  - This patient has a hemolytic anemia with a 
significant shistocytosis.  
The average shishtocytosis in TTP is 8.45% (with a 
range of 1% to 18%); her shistocytosi
s was 5%.  Her elevated LDH is also 
confirmatory of her shistocytosis.  
On her admission for TTP in 1996, her renal 
biopsy showed a thrombotic microangioma
.  Repeating renal biopsy would cause 
unnecessary morbidity in this case since 
the diagnosis is already quite certain. 
Thrombocyopenia, often with purpura – 
This patient does ha
ve a significant 
thrombocytopenia, with a platelet count 
of 66.  In addition large platelets and 
clumping of platelets were noted on the 
peripheral blood smear, but of which are 
indicative of TTP.  Some purpura were noted
 on physical exam, but they were not 
particularly prominent.   
Acute renal insufficiency that may be associ
ated with anuria – This patient has acute 
renal failure, with a BUN of 119 and a cr
eatinine of 13.6.  She is oliguric (about 
30 cc/hour), but not anuric. 
Neurologic abnormalities, usually fluctuat
ing – The patient has several notable 
neurological abnormalities, but several of th
ese seem to be present at baseline for 
her.  The two abnormalities that the 
patient and her daughter acknowledge are 
new are her significant daytime somnolence 
and her headaches.  Headache is the 
most common neurologic
 symptom found in TTP. 
Fever – The patient has been afebrile by hi
story and has not had a fever in her first 
several hours in the hospital. 
The presence of four out of these five di
agnostic criteria is 
very suggestive for a 
diagnosis of TTP.  In fact, “fever” is th
e most commonly absent of the diagnostic 
pentad for TTP, especially in newer case se
ries.  It has even been suggested that 
fever may not be a symptom of TTP at all, but may be caused by complications of 
TTP, such as sepsis. 
Differential Diagnosis: 
The main other diagnosis to consider in this
 clinical picture is 
diffuse intravascular 
coagulation (DIC).  This diagnosis has 
been ruled out with a DIC screen that 
showed slightly elevated fibrinogen levels
 and undetectable levels of fragmented 
D-dimer.  The presence of normal (or slig
htly above normal in
 this case) shows 
that fibrinogen is not being consumed 
by DIC, and the absence of D-dimer also 
shows that the coagulation pathway is not
 actively taking place in this patient. 
Precipitating Factors: 
Most cases of TTP are idiopathic.  In 
some cases, however, a single precipitating 
factor of TTP can found to be present.  We
 will look for such a factor in this case, 
both to explain why the patient developed TTP
 and so that the pr
ecipitating factor 
can be treated.  Potential 
precipitating factors include: 
Gastrointestinal infections, most co
mmonly Shiga toxin-producing bacteria 
such as E. coli 0157:H7 – Fecal samples have been sent for fecal 
leukocytes, culture, fecal parasite 
screen, and C. dificil toxin. 
Drugs – The patient has not started a
ny new drugs recently, and none of the 
drugs she is on are commonly known to 
precipitate TTP.  Specifically, she 
does not take quinine or dr
ink liquids high in quinine
.  Other drugs that are 
thought to precipitate TTP include
 cyclosporine, tacrolimus, OKT3, 
ticlopidine, clopidogrel, a
nd valacyclovir.  The patient is not on any of 
these agents. 
Antiphospholipid Antibodies – A screen for the antibody most commonly 
implicated antibody, anti-cardiolipin, 
has been sent and is pending.  A 
screen for RBC IgG was negative 
HIV – HIV has been reported to precip
itate TTP, so testing this patient for 
HIV will be considered. 
Cancer – Neoplastic processes can precipita
te TTP, so once the patient is past 
the acute phase of her TTP, efforts will be made to improve her cancer 
screening, as well as her general heal
th maintenance.  Specifically, she 
should receive a colonoscopy, especially since she is guiac positive, and 
she should receive a mammogram since she has apparently not had one in 
several years. 
Pregnancy and Oral Contraceptives – Th
e patient is not pregnant, nor does she 
take oral contraceptives or
 any other hormone therapy. 
Pneumococcal Infection – This patient 
does not have any signs or symptoms 
of pneumococcal infection. 
Treatment 
Treatment for TTP is plasmapheresis and 
administration of fresh frozen plasma 
(FFP).  One randomized trial has shown this th
erapy to increase survival from 50% to 
78% in patients with TTP (N Engl J Me
d 1991 Aug 8;325(6):393-7).  A vascath has 
been placed in the patient’s femoral vei
n, and she will receive plasmapheresis once a 
day, along with daily administration of FFP. 
The rational behind this treatment is that
 plasmapheresis clears from the blood the 
anti-ADAMTS antibody, which causes ADAM
TS13 deficiency and the resulting 
inability of the platelets to convert unusua
lly large von Willebrand 
factor (ULVWf) to  
Von Willebrand factor (VWf).  Transfusion 
of FFP helps to replete antibodies and 
other plasma proteins that are lost during 
the course of plasmaphe
resis.  Anaphalaxic 
and other anaphalactoid reac
tions occur commonly following transfusion of FFP, and 
are treated with epinephrine and co
rticosteroids when they occur. 
If plasmapheresis is not showing a meas
urable result within
 several days, IV 
corticosteroid therapy will be added to th
is therapy.  Approxima
tely 10-15 percent of 
patients do not respond to plasmapheresis.
  These patients are thought to have 
ADAMTS13 deficiency due to some cau
se other than anti-ADAMTS13 antibody.  
Administration of corticosteroid
 is of questionable efficacy 
in these patients, but it is 
currently the only therapy avai
lable.  Since this patient 
showed a very good response 
to plasmapheresis and FFP transfusion on her 
last admission, it is expected that she 
will show a positive response again. 
2) Acute Renal Failure
This patient has acute renal failure, w
ith a BUN of 119 and 
a creatinine of 13.6, 
on top of her preexisting chronic renal insu
fficiency (baseline cr
eatinine is 1.7).  The 
cause of this renal failure is TTP, so it 
will be treated by treating the underlying TTP, as 
described above.  In addition, the patient’s La
six, Atenolol, and Norv
asc are being held.  
These drug are being held both because they 
can impair renal function during episodes of 
acute renal failure, and because, in the setting 
of the large volume shifts associated with 
plasmaphoresis, they may complicate the clin
ical picture and make assessment of the 
patient’s fluid status more di
fficult.  Norvasc will be restarted if the patient becomes 
significantly hypertensive, and 
lasix can be administered 
if she develops pulmonary 
edema. 
  The patient currently has no indications for dialysis, but we will continue to 
monitor for these indications, such as aci
demia, altered mental status, dangerous 
electrolyte abnormalities, volume overload, dr
ug overdose, and symptomatic uremia.  We 
will avoid giving patient any contrast dye as 
long as renal function is
 poor, and will take 
renal function into account when dosing medicati
ons.  It is very posible that this patient’s 
renal function will never return to it’s base
line, and that she will suffer some permanent 
kidney damage as a result of this episode of 
TTP, just as she did dur
ing her last episode 
of TTP. 
3) Anemia
This patient is anemic, with a hematocrit of 0.34.  This is a hemolytic anemia, and is 
caused by her TTP.  Treatment of this anemia w
ill be to treat its underlying cause – TTP.  
She will be transfused if her hematocrit con
tinues to fall or if she begins to show 
increased symptoms of anemia.  The patient’s type and screen will be kept up to date 
4) Thrombocytopenia
This patient is thrombocytopenic, with a platel
et count of 66.  This is caused by her TTP, 
so its treatment will be to treat the TTP.  She currently has no acute bleeds, is 
hemodynamically stable, and has no indications 
for platelet transfusion.  The patient’s 
Aspirin will be held during this hospitalizat
ion, because there is no need to inhibit the 
platelet function of a patient
 who is thrombocytopenic. 
5) Diarrhea
The patient’s diarrhea appears to be fairly 
mild, and it is not among her most significant 
complaints.  It does not appear to be causi
ng excessive volume lo
ss or any electrolyte 
abnormalities.  As described above, fecal samp
les have been sent for fecal leukocytes, 
culture, fecal parasite screen, a
nd C. dificil toxin.  If a trea
table cause of her diarrhea is 
found, it will be treated appropriately. 
6) Hypertenison
The patient’s antihypertensives are currently being held to ensure adequate renal 
perfusion during her acute renal insufficie
ncy.  We will monitor the patient’s blood 
pressure, and will reinstitue antihypertensi
ve therapy if she 
becomes more than 
moderately hypertensive.  This 
is especially important in 
this patient since she has a 
history of a hypertensive stroke. 
7) Elevated transaminasaes
The patient has mildly elevated transaminases.
  Elevated transaminasaes are normally not 
associated with TTP, so this needs to be expl
ained in some other way.  A likely cause of 
these elevated levels is that the patient takes 
Lipitor.  Her Lipitor will be held while she is 
in the hospital, because it may be complicating the clinical picture, and 
hypercholesterolemia is significantly less likely
 the cause morbidity or mortality while 
this patient is in the hospital than is her TTP. 
8) Health maintenance
The details of this patient’s health maintena
nce are currently unclear.  Records will be 
obtained from her PCP.  Once her TTP has been treated, follow up will be arranged with 
her PCP, and additional health screening w
ill be encouraged.  Specifically, she should 
receive a colonoscopy and a mammo
gram, as described above. 
9) Prophylaxis
GI – Protonix, 40 mg PO daily 
DVT – SVDs in place bilaterally.  DVT is un
likely since the patient 
is thrombocytopenic. 
10) Code status
This has been discussed with the pati
ent and she desires to be a full code. 
11) Disposition
The patient will need to stay 
in the hospital until this episode
 of TTP has resolved.  We 
anticipate this will take approximately eight da
ys, since her last episode of TTP resolved 
after eight days of therapy.  TTP is however
, a very serious diseas
e with a significant 
mortality rate, so it is very 
possible that her TTP does not 
resolve quickly, or that other 
complications arise.  It is also possible 
that her renal function will be significantly 
impaired after this hospitalization.  Patient will
 most likely return to her home in Durham 
following discharge.
