PATIENT PROFILE:
This is a 43 yo married Malaysian-American female. 
CHIEF COMPLAINT:
Abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting 
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
This is a 43 year old Malaysian-American fema
le with a medical history significant for a 
laparoscopic cholecystectomy in 2002.  Sin
ce the birth of her second child in 1992, she 
has had periodic episodes of abdominal pain
 with or without N/V about every 6-24 
months, usually localized to the RUQ.  
Most of these episodes have resolved 
spontaneously without medical care, but she 
has sought medical care
 on several of these 
occasions.  In August of 2002, she underw
ent a laparoscopic cholecystectomy.  
Following this operation, she continued to have
 periodic abdominal pain, of the same 
character and at the same frequency as wh
at she had been experiencing before her 
operation. 
She presents with her latest of
 these episodes.  She had been 
in her usual state of health, 
until she woke up on Tuesday (4/12) morning with a constant, pinching abdominal pain 
localized to the right upper and middle upper 
abdomen.  She also felt nauseous, but did 
not vomit.  This pain got worse with intake 
of food, and seemed to improve after several 
hours of not eating.  By Wednesday morning, he
r symptoms had mostly resolved, but she 
continued to feel some mild abdominal discom
fort.  This mild discomfort continued until 
Saturday morning, when she began to feel 
significantly worse.  Her abdominal pain 
increased significantly (10/10) and she began to
 vomit everything she ate.  By Saturday 
afternoon, she became diaphoretic and her pa
in continued to increase.  She took a 
Kroger’s antacid Saturday evening, but othe
rwise did not do anything to treat these 
symptoms herself.  She presented to the D
uke ED early Sunday morning, where care was 
initiated and the patient was admitted to the 
Gen Med 4 service.  She denies having chest 
pain, dyspnea, fevers, chills, back pain, and 
diarrhea at any point during this episode.  
Her most recent bowel movement was Saturday
 evening, and it was dark brown in color. 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1) s/p laparoscopic cholec
ystectomy, August 2002, DRH, pathology showed chronic 
cholecystitis 
2) Occasional RUQ pain , +/- N/V, every 
6-24 months since 1992, as described in HPI 
3) Upper endoscopy in October 2002 at DRH fo
r epigastric pain w/
 normal LFTs showed 
mild gastritis, but unable to e
xplain the patient’s symptoms 
4) Upper endoscopy in Malaysia, date, 
indication and results not available 
5) s/p tubal ligation, 1992 
6) biopsy of endocervical polyp in 2003, 
showed benign columnar endocervical 
epithelium 
CURRENT MEDICATIONS:
Patient does not take any regular medicati
on.  She does take multivitamins, vitamin C, 
and calcium supplements “on and off.”  She t
ook one tablet of Kroge
r’s antacid Saturday 
evening, but she does not take antacid regularly. 
ALLERGIES/SENSITIVITIES:
NKDA
SOCIAL HISTORY:
The patient was born in Malaysia, and lived there until her early 20s, when she moved to 
the United States with her husband.  She gr
ew up in a semi-rural area she frequently 
swam in the rivers.  Her native language 
is Hokkien.  She is not aware of any 
gastrointestinal or other diseas
es that are endemic to the area she is from.  She currently 
lives in Durham with her husband and their tw
o children, all of whom are healthy.  They 
own and manage a Chinese rest
aurant called “Shanghai.”  Her 
aunt (Fong) also lives in 
Durham.  She has no pets, has not eaten any 
new foods recently, and has no recent sick 
contacts.  Her most recent travel was to 
Malaysia last summer.  She has never used 
alcohol, tobacco, or any other drugs 
HEALTH MAINENANCE:

tails regarding her health maintenance were 
not obtained.  
FAMILY HISTORY:

sion, but is otherwise healthy.  Her father 
is healthy and has no medical problems that
 she knows of.  She does not know of any 
diseases that run in the family, 
gastrointestinal or otherwise.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
Vital Signs
 – temp 36.4°C, BP 112/60, pulse 70, RR 20

or abdomen. 
Lymph nodes

aclavicular, axillar
y lymphadenectomy. 
HEENT

opharynx was clear and mucosa was moist.  
Dentition mostly present. 
Neck

JVD. 
Chest
 – Chest symmetric.  Lung clear to auscultation bilaterally. 
strategy.  Finally, if analysis of
 the recovered stones show them
 to be composed of a large 
component of cholesterol (which is unlik
ely since cholesterol 
stones are typically 
radiolucent, and the at least one of this pati
ent’s stones appears to be radioopaque, since it 
was seen on her chest radiograph) she was 
benefit from chronic ursodeoxycholic acid 
(UCDA) which is thought to have some 
efficacy in preventing the formation of 
cholesterol stones.  This is also unlikely 
because most stones s
een in patients with 
oriental cholangiohepatitis are composed of calcium bilirubinate. 
2) Pain Management
This patient was experiencing 10/10 pain at
 the time of her presentation, and it is 
important to treat this pain so that she is
 as comfortable as possible.  Morphine and 
toradol gave her little relief 
in ED.  Further, morphine is 
thought to cause 
contraction of 
the sphincter of Odis, which could worsen th
is patient’s symptoms and make ERCP more 
difficult.  Her pain will therefore be
 treated with Dilaudid, 1mg IV q4h prn. 
3) Hypokalemia
This patient has a mild hypokalemia, which 
is most likely caused by the transcellular 
exchange of K
+
 for H
+
 to compensate for the non-anion gap metabolic alkalosis caused 
by vomiting.  We will give patient NS
 with 20 meq KCl to replace this K
+
. 
4) Hyperglycemia
The patient was initially hyperglycemia on pres
entation, and has no history of diabetes.  
Her hypoglycemia is most likely 
a result of the general infl
ammatory state associated 
with her ascending cholangitis.  It is also
 possible that she has 
previously undiagnosed 
diabetes.  Her blood sugar became significant be
tter controlled (at 116 and 92) after being 
given IVFs and Unasyn.  This supports the theo
ry that this patient’s hyperglycemia was 
being caused by her infection.  Acute mana
gement of her hyperglycemia will be to 
monitor it with q6h Accuchecks and to treat 
it with sliding scale 
insulin as needed.  
Control of blood sugar is esp
ecially important in the se
tting of an infection since 
hyperglycemia can promote infection and worsen sepsis when it exists.  We will also 
measure a hemoglobin A1C to rule 
out diabetes in this patient. 
5) Abnormal Urinalysis
This patient’s urinalysis showed 1+ protei
n, 2+ glucose, 3+ ke
tone, 1+ blood, 20 rbcs, 
and 8 wbcs.  The glucose found in this pati
ent’s urine was somewhat surprising since 
glucose is generally not found in urine unt
il the plasma glucose exceeds 300, but this 
patient’s glucose was measured to be 256 
on Chem7. The glucose found in her urine is 
best explained by the fact that her blood gl
ucose may have been higher at some other 
point in time, such as immediately after 
she ate.  Simliarly, the ketones found were 
somewhat surprising, but it is very likely that
 she had a mild ketosis as a result of her 
hyperglycemia.  Having no eaten for several da
ys probably lowered the glucose threshold 
above which ketones are produced. 
The blood is likely present in her urine sin
ce her patient is currently at the end of 
her menstrual period, and her urine sample c
ould have easily been contaminated with 
some menstrual bleeding.   There is no obvi
ous explanation for the wbcs or protein found 
in this patient’s urine, unless she has a UTI 
or some other kidney disease.  The patient 
does not currently have any urinary symp
toms, and her creatinine is 0.6, so these 
abnormalities on urinalysis or not very concer
ning.  Will repeat this urinalysis, and 
consider further workup if abnormalities persist. 
6) Health Maintenance
Will request medical records from PCP in morning during business hours. 
7) Prophylaxis
GI – 40 mg PO daily 
DVT – SCDs in place to LEs bilaterally 
8) Code status
This was not discussed with the patient, so she is a full code by default. 
9) Disposition
This patient will be discharged once the obstr
uctions in her common bile duct have been 
addressed, the underlying cause of her chole
docolithiasis has been investigated, and her 
symptoms have resolved.  We 
anticipate this will take 2-4 
days, but it may be longer if 
ERCP is unsuccessful
