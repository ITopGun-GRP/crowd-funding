HPI: Mr. Smith is a 46-year-old gentleman with hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, severe hand and feet dermatitis and tobacco abuse. He presents for follow-up of hospitalization at Rex. He presented 5 days ago with 24 hours of mid epigastric pain. This did go away with nitroglycerin in an urgent care clinic. EKG showed minimal Q-waves inferiorly. He ruled out. He had an exercise treadmill test, which showed 1 mm ST depression in the lateral leads without chest pain, but the test was limited by severe leg pain/claudication. He also had a chest x-ray, which showed a small nodular density posterior to the heart on the lateral view. It was felt to be probably a vessel seen on end. He was discharged on his usual medications to follow up here. Today, he reports he continues to feel well and that his midepigastric pain has not returned. Since I saw him last, he has started using his treadmill at home. He has not gotten any chest pain or midepigastric pain or shortness of breath with this, but has felt a burning in his calves. On the plus side, his dermatitis is doing the best that it has in more than 15 years. He is not sure why this is happening. He is also tapering down his smoking. He is down to a pack and a half a day. He is hoping to eventually quit.

MEDICATIONS: Include atorvastatin 20 mg a day, aspirin 325 mg a day, amlodipine 10 mg a day, enalapril 20 mg a day, triamcinolone ointment.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: CARDIOVASCULAR: No palpitations, PND, orthopnea or edema. RESPIRATORY: No cough. GASTROINTESTINAL: No abdominal pain or change in bowel habits.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:

VITAL SIGNS: Weight is 100 kg, blood pressure is 114/75, pulse is 76. GENERAL: Looks well.

LUNGS: Clear.

HEART: Regular rate and rhythm without murmur, rub or gallop.

ABDOMEN: Normal active bowel sounds, soft, non-tender, no hepatosplenomegaly, no masses

EXTREMITIES: 1+ posterior tibialis bilaterally. Feet are warm and capillary refill a bit slow but still less than 2 seconds. Decreased hair.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:

    Midepigastric pain. More likely GI in origin. Certainly with many atypical features for cardiovascular origin but he also has multiple risk factors for CAD, had tiny Q-waves, and an abnormal stress test. We will continue with his current cardiovascular medications, including aspirin, statin, ACE-inhibitor and calcium channel blocker. Will get a dobutamine echocardiogram.
    Probable peripheral vascular disease. We will get duplex scan and ankle brachial index. Same meds as above. Continue exercise.
    He was strongly encouraged to continue to pursue his efforts to quit smoking.
    Possible abnormal chest xray. Will repeat today.
    Return to clinic at his regular appointment in June. We will be in touch about his results before then.
