 the lower right leg. 
HPI:
 This is a 42 year old lady who travels 
frequently, has a history of melanoma, and 
h/o traumatic splenectomy who comes in today with a 4 day history of intermittent, 
stabbing pain in the right leg near the calf. On
 Friday she returned from a business trip in 
Ireland. On Saturday morning she was running 
when she fell and abra
ded her right lower 
leg. She thinks that she tri
pped, as this was early in th
e morning and it was dark. She 
cleaned the wound and applied Neosporin. The pain
 developed that day 
in her calf, in an 
area of the leg close to but not within the ab
raded area. She describes the pain as stabbing 
and sometimes throbbing, with a 3-5 pain rating on a scale of 1-10. It seems to be 
ameliorated by elevation, ice and Ibuprofe
n. The pain comes more frequently with 
walking, and has interfered with both her exer
cise and her work. It is also worse when 
she presses on the area. The pain is getting wo
rse. She says the scraped area appears to be 
healing.  She denies any feeling of tiredness, 
fever, chills, paresthesia, numbness and is 
able to walk on the leg. She also denies any ch
est pain or shortness of breath. swelling in 
the leg  She has never been previously diagnos
ed with a blood clot. 
She is a smoker, 20 
pack years. She is not on birth control. Sh
e has no history of hypertension. 12 years ago 
she had a splenectomy following an accident, and says she has had the vaccinations her 
doctor recommended. 10 years ago she had 
a melanoma of unknown stage removed from 
her left arm, and continues to 
follow up with her dermatologist.

Differential Diagnosis
:  
1.
Deep Vein Thrombosis
: This patient’s history of smoking, recent stasis with 
travel and a possibility of cancer recu
rrence make DVT a possible diagnosis. 
DVT is also the most immediately fatal pos
sibility, and so it must be considered 
first. It is not the DVT itself that 
is dangerous, for there is usually enough 
compensating veins to retu
rn the blood eventually, 
but rather the pulmonary 
embolism that can result when a DVT move
s from its original position. 5-20% of 
Calf DVTs progress to pulmonary embolis
m, and 20-30% progress to the thigh, 
which increases the chances of pulmonary embolism to 50%
1
. According to 
Harrison’s Principle of Internal Medici
ne, a DVT in the calf is difficult to 
diagnosis from physical examination alone
. Symptoms may include “calf pain... 
posterior calf tenderness, warmth, incr
eased tissue turgor or modest swelling... 
Homans’ sign is an unreliable diagnostic sign.”

 By Wells' Pretest Probability 
criteria of suspected Deep Vein Thrombos
is, this patient has 
a score of -2, giving 
her a Low pretest probability. Even if
 she does have an undiagnosed active 
cancer, her score would be in the same proba
bility with a score of -1. Therefore, a 
negative ultrasound of the ar
ea is enough to rule out a DVT. In addition, a D-
Dimer result of less than 200 to 500 ng/mL
 with a Low Wells score has a 99% 
negative predictive value for ruling out
 DVT. However, these scores were 
developed in secondary care 
centers, and patients presenting to primary care have 
a higher rate of missed DVT.
 3
 Therefore, an ultrasound should be done, 
regardless of the D-Dimer score. 
2.
Stress Fracture of the Tibia
: Many of the patient’s symptoms are suggestive of a 
stress fracture: she has a sharp, locali
zed pain and tenderness, some swelling 
without erythema, and the pain is exacerba
ted with walking. Stress fractures often 
occur in athletes such as runners from 
overuse, but other causes can include poor 
footwear, running on uneven terrain, and nutrition problems such as anorexia and 
osteoporosis. An x-ray could confirm a st
ress fracture, but confirmation occurs 
less than 50% of the time in the first two weeks following the injury. Mild stress 
fractures are treated with elevation and i
ce, and switching or a
voiding the exercise 
that caused the fracture for 6 weeks.

3.
Muscle Strain
: It is possible that this lady 
has pulled a muscle in her leg. 
Diagnosis of a muscle injury when there is
 no restriction in movement is difficult, 
and the treatment is the same as for a stress fracture.  
4.
Cellulitis
: Cellulitis in a lower limb is alwa
ys a differential diagnosis for DVT. I 
think an infection of the skin is unlikel
y in this patient because there is no 
erythema, local lymphadenopathy, abscesses 
or lesions. Also the pain is coming 
from deep in the leg, not th
e upper skin and fat layer. 
Her history of splenectomy 
makes the possibility of infection by encap
sulated bacteria worrisome, but at this 
point her symptoms suggest
 a different diagnosis.

5.
Ruptured Baker’s Cyst
: A Baker’s cyst is a popliteal
 bursitis that results from 
overuse of the knee. This patient has 
no history suggestive of a Baker’s Cyst, 
since there was no pain, swelling, or moveme
nt restriction of the knee prior to her 
fall. A ruptured Baker’s Cyst can result in
 pain in the posterior calf muscles, and 
treatment is directed to the underlying cause or disease.

Plan:
Diagnostic:  I recommend immediate duplex 
venous ultrasonography 
of her right lower 
leg. The sensitivity of this test for calf DVT 
is 75%. I would not do 
a D-Dimer test, since 
both a positive and a negative D-Dimer will lead
 to an ultrasound as the next step. Her 
pre-test probability of DVT is low, so pr
ovided the D-Dimer test 
is negative, I would 
Therapeutic plan:  advise this 
patient to continue to let the 
leg rest as she has been doing, 
with elevation and ice. An x-ray for a stress fr
acture of the tibia is positive less than 50% 
of the time in the first two weeks following an
 injury, so I would get an x-ray but treat 
even if negative. If a stress 
fracture is diagnosed, we would 
need to talk about footwear, 
proper running technique, nutr
ition, etc. Crutches might be helpful if walking continues 
to be a problem. She may return to work
 provided she not doing any strenuous activity 
while there. If she noted any changes in the 
pain or in the wound, I 
would advise her to 
come back in for further 
examination. If she has any shortness of 
breath, she should go immediately to the 
emergency room.
