## Description

Pretrained named entity recognition deep learning model for extracting clinical concepts from text.

## Predicted Entities

`Diagnosis`, `Procedure_Name`, `Lab_Result`, `Procedure`, `Procedure_Findings`, `O2_Saturation`, `Procedure_incident_description`, `Dosage`, `Causative_Agents_(Virus_and_Bacteria)`, `Name`, `Cause_of_death`, `Substance_Name`, `Weight`, `Symptom_Name`, `Maybe`, `Modifier`, `Blood_Pressure`, `Frequency`, `Gender`, `Drug_incident_description`, `Age`, `Drug_Name`, `Temperature`, `Section_Name`, `Route`, `Negation`, `Negated`, `Allergenic_substance`, `Lab_Name`, `Respiratory_Rate`.

## How to use



<div class="tabs-box" markdown="1">
{% include programmingLanguageSelectScalaPythonNLU.html %}
```python

embeddings_clinical = WordEmbeddingsModel.pretrained("embeddings_clinical", "en", "clinical/models")  .setInputCols(["sentence", "token"])  .setOutputCol("embeddings")

One day ago, mom also noticed a tactile temperature and gave the patient Tylenol. Baby also has had some decreased p.o. intake. His normal breast-feeding is down from 20 minutes q.2h. to 5 to 10 minutes secondary to his respiratory congestion. He sleeps well, but has been more tired and has been fussy over the past 2 days. The parents noticed no improvement with albuterol treatments given in the ER. His urine output has also decreased; normally he has 8 to 10 wet and 5 dirty diapers per 24 hours, now he has down to 4 wet diapers per 24 hours. Mom denies any diarrhea. His bowel movements are yellow colored and soft in nature."]})))
